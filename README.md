# DogfyDiet Platform

A cloud-native full-stack application deployed on Google Cloud Platform, demonstrating microservices architecture, Infrastructure as Code, and modern DevOps practices.

## Architecture Overview

This solution implements a microservices-based architecture with:
- **Frontend**: Vue.js SPA hosted on Google Cloud Storage
- **Backend**: Two microservices deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine
- **Messaging**: Event-driven communication via Google Pub/Sub
- **Database**: Google Firestore for NoSQL data storage
- **Infrastructure**: Managed via Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment
